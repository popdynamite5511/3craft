# 3craft

3d Minecraft clone made using the Ursina game engine in Python. Based on https://github.com/kairess/minecraft-clone

System Requirements:

Mac OS X 10.6 or later

Windows Vista or later

The game can also be run on Linux distributions. I'm not sure of the minimum requirement, you'll have to find that out yourself, but it'll most likely work for almost all computers.
