# 3craft

3d Minecraft clone made using the Ursina game engine in Python. Based on https://github.com/kairess/minecraft-clone

System Requirements:

Mac OS X 10.6 or later

Windows Vista or later

The game can also be run on Linux distributions. I'm not sure of the minimum requirement, you'll have to find that out yourself, but it'll most likely work for almost all computers.

PLEASE NOTE THAT VERSIONS OF MAC OS X OLDER THAN 10.11.6 WILL MOST LIKELY WORK, BUT I DO NOT SUPPORT THEM SINCE I AM UNABLE TO FIX BUGS FOR THOSE OS VERSIONS, I HAVE NO WAY TO DO SO AS I DO NOT HAVE ANY OLD HARDWARE, AND THESE OLD OS VERSIONS ARE NO LONGER USED IN MOST SITUATIONS!
If you find a bug for those old OS versions, YOU are responsible for fixing them yourself and making a pull request.
